## It's always sunny in Gothenburg

Web app for getting some statistics about the weather in Gothenburg the last 96 hours

The app is build with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and uses the [openweathermap api](https://openweathermap.org/) for getting the temperatures.

### Todo:

Didn't have time to add caching with redis so there is a possibility that I hit the limit of 60 request/minute :(
